## 💡 Design & UX Tips (for a standout portfolio)

* Keep the hero concise — one-line elevator pitch + two CTAs (View Projects, Contact Me)
* Use high-quality screenshots or GIFs for project previews
* Add short case-study-style descriptions for 2–4 best projects (problem, approach, result)
* Include metrics where possible: load time improvements, downloads, users, or performance numbers
* Make contact obvious — include a contact form and direct mailto link
* Add subtle micro-interactions (hover states, animated entrance) to make the site feel alive
